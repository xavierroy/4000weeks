# Life in Weeks

This is an interactive map of my life, where each week I've been alive is a little box. The box's border color represents where I was living, the fill color what I was doing that week. Tap a box to see what I was doing where that week.

I made this to help myself see the bigger picture of the road I've walked. Read more about [Life in Weeks at Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).

This code was copied and adapted from [Buster Benson](https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks). It is a single webpage statically-rendered with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) hosted on Netlify. It consists of a [data file](data/life-in-weeks.yml), (an introduction)[index.markdown], and a [Liquid template](_layouts/life-in-weeks.html).

## Colophon

This page uses a [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) template for markup, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for layout and interaction, with a smidge of [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to reflect the current week on the map.

The font is [Red Hat Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Red+Hat+Display). Colors chosen via [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/). Edited in [Zed](https://zed.dev).
